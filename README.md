# Frontend Mentor - Huddle page

This is a challange from the site Frontend Mentor, and the proposal is to compose a card following the layout defined in the challenge.

This exercise was a great HTML and CSS training and helped me to better understand the application of Flexbox which makes layout positioning much easier.
